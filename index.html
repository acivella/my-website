            <h1 class="top2-intro" style="text-color:black">Over 30 years ago, Willie launched his fireworks business. Over the years, he operated three locations, but this one has always been his pride and joy. I’ve known Willie for most of my life, and 15 years ago, I was lucky enough to become not just his fiancée, but also his partner in the business. It was clear how much joy and energy fireworks season brought him.

When Willie fell ill at the end of the 2020 season, I stepped in to continue running what he had built. I was determined to carry on his love for fireworks because of how much this business meant to both of us.

Since 2021, I’ve proudly continued operating at the 291 and 58 Highway location. I’m deeply grateful for all of Willie’s loyal customers who have stayed with us through the years, and I look forward to seeing you each season.
            Thank you,
            Fanny</h1>
